Finally, the {SQLite} database is updated regularly as new data is added to {GEO} and can be downloaded at will for the most up-to-date metadata. {GEOmetadb} paper: http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/24/23/2798 .},

Several such normalization methods exist, some of which rely on spike-in genes, molecules added in known quantities to serve as a basis for a normalization model. Depending on available information and the type of data, some methods may express certain advantages over others. We compare the effectiveness of seven available normalization methods designed specifically for single-cell sequencing, using two real data sets containing spike-in genes and one simulation study. Additionally, we test those methods not dependent on spike-in genes using a real data set with three distinct cell-cycle states and a real data set under the 10X Genomics {GemCode} platform with multiple cell types represented. We demonstrate the differences in effectiveness for the featured methods using visualization and classification assessment and conclude which methods are preferable for normalizing a certain type of data for further downstream analysis, such as classification or differential analysis. The comparison in computational time for all methods is addressed as well.},

We used well-matched {snRNA}-seq and {scRNA}-seq datasets from mouse visual cortex to compare cell type detection. Although more transcripts are detected in individual whole cells ({\textasciitilde}11,000 genes) than nuclei ({\textasciitilde}7,000 genes), we demonstrate that closely related neuronal cell types can be similarly discriminated with both methods if intronic sequences are included in {snRNA}-seq analysis. We estimate that the nuclear proportion of total cellular {mRNA} varies from 20\% to over 50\% for large and small pyramidal neurons, respectively.

Single-cell transcriptomics data can now be complemented by chromatin accessibility, surface protein expression, adaptive immune receptor repertoire profiling and spatial information. The increasing availability of single-cell data across modalities has motivated the development of novel computational methods to help analysts derive biological insights. As the field grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to navigate the vast landscape of tools and analysis steps. Here, we summarize independent benchmarking studies of unimodal and multimodal single-cell analysis across modalities to suggest comprehensive best-practice workflows for the most common analysis steps. Where independent benchmarks are not available, we review and contrast popular methods.

	abstract = {Mapping single-cell sequencing profiles to comprehensive reference datasets provides a powerful alternative to unsupervised analysis. However, most reference datasets are constructed from single-cell {RNA}-sequencing data and cannot be used to annotate datasets that do not measure gene expression. Here we introduce ‘bridge integration’, a method to integrate single-cell datasets across modalities using a multiomic dataset as a molecular bridge. Each cell in the multiomic dataset constitutes an element in a ‘dictionary’, which is used to reconstruct unimodal datasets and transform them into a shared space. Our procedure accurately integrates transcriptomic data with independent single-cell measurements of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, {DNA} methylation and protein levels. Moreover, we demonstrate how dictionary learning can be combined with sketching techniques to improve computational scalability and harmonize 8.6 million human immune cell profiles from sequencing and mass cytometry experiments. Our approach, implemented in version 5 of our Seurat toolkit (http://www.satijalab.org/seurat), broadens the utility of single-cell reference datasets and facilitates comparisons across diverse molecular modalities.},

	abstract = {A broad range of brain pathologies critically relies on the vasculature, and cerebrovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. However, the cellular and molecular architecture of the human brain vasculature remains incompletely understood1. Here we performed single-cell {RNA} sequencing analysis of 606,380 freshly isolated endothelial cells, perivascular cells and other tissue-derived cells from 117 samples, from 68 human fetuses and adult patients to construct a molecular atlas of the developing fetal, adult control and diseased human brain vasculature. We identify extensive molecular heterogeneity of the vasculature of healthy fetal and adult human brains and across five vascular-dependent central nervous system ({CNS}) pathologies, including brain tumours and brain vascular malformations. We identify alteration of arteriovenous differentiation and reactivated fetal as well as conserved dysregulated genes and pathways in the diseased vasculature. Pathological endothelial cells display a loss of {CNS}-specific properties and reveal an upregulation of {MHC} class {II} molecules, indicating atypical features of {CNS} endothelial cells. Cell–cell interaction analyses predict substantial endothelial-to-perivascular cell ligand–receptor cross-talk, including immune-related and angiogenic pathways, thereby revealing a central role for the endothelium within brain neurovascular unit signalling networks. Our single-cell brain atlas provides insights into the molecular architecture and heterogeneity of the developing, adult/control and diseased human brain vasculature and serves as a powerful reference for future studies.},
